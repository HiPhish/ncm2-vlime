 Vlime-based completion for NCM2
#################################

This plugin provides `NCM2`_ completion using the `Vlime`_ plugin for Vim and
Neovim in Common Lisp source code.

.. _NCM2: https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/
.. _Vlime: https://github.com/l04m33/vlime/


Installation
############

Install ncm2-vlime like any other Vim plugin. In addition you also need NCM2
and Vlime installed, please follow their respective instructions.


Quickstart
##########

Completion will work out of the box as long as the current buffer has the file
type `lisp` and there is a Vlime connection for the buffer. Otherwise nothing
will happen.
